          <h1><strong>"Machine Learning"-What and why </strong></h1>
          <p>
            Programming has made a revolution around globe. It opened ways to
            many new sectors because of its 2 stunning abilities.......
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Store (DATA)information</li>
            <li>following logic (expressed by humans)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Programming is marvelous leap in mankind... But to perform
            programming we always needed a human to verify and give the logic to
            a computer(Machine). It always needed a human to show it a logic to
            follow..
          </p>
          <p>
            Example let there is a program code of function to find max of two
            numbers let there will be a "IF"conditional branching. system knows
            whats the type of task to perform at "IF" condition but it
            absolutely has no idea of what "IF" statements role is in finding
            the max of two functions but human knows why "IF" suits there
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words to make a program to work we humans need to manually
            analyse and give it all the logical conditions so that the computer
            need not know to what logic is happening in code and just has to
            follow the conditions given
          </p>

          <h1><strong>HOW MACHINE LEARNING WORKS</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Machine Learning goal is to just analyze the way in which we Human
            learn....and copy it on machines......
          </p>
          <p>
            So now,our goal is to figure out how we (humans) learn before making
            machines learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><i>Let me ask u few questions....</i></strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If i show u few pics of helicopter and plane how are u able to
              find which is helicopter?
            </li>
            <li>
              How are u able to say who is best hitter.....best Scorer .....best
              bowler...... Best all-rounder in a Cricket series?
            </li>
            <li>
              If u are a pro bike rider then how learned to be a pro rider?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Think a second on what process is going on inside before answering
            above questions
          </p>
          <p><strong>Let's look into first question</strong></p>
          <p>
            Let's ask a ancient King to find helicopter in pics.... Can he do
            it.... Why?now... Can you do it.... S..... Why because u were feeded
            with lots of pictures from your childhood through sources like
            books, movies, or even in reality And u have data of all the
            helicopter pics.... In your head....... And u analyzed patterns In
            the pics.....and now u are trying to sync your patterns analyzed by
            vast past data to sync with new data ...and you will confirm it as a
            helicopter..... If the %of sync of patterns is enough
          </p>
          <p><strong>In 2nd case ,</strong></p>
          <p>
            To, say Who is the best player more accurately...... U have to
            observe every player in every match of the series[ collect data of
            every player for every ball ]........ and u will analyze By looking
            at each ones special abilitys from performance [ data related to how
            specific player contributed to each ball in the over ]........then
            we will analyzing (outstanding) best player with special ability by
            comparing players [data of each player with same special ability ]
          </p>
          <p><strong>In 3rd case,</strong></p>
          <p>
            U might be a pro rider now, but there must be a day when u first
            touched it's handle bar.... like a absolute beginner....u might have
            started slow...experimented few actions like Leaning bike at
            turning...... And making sudden break at slippery surface.......u
            might have done many actions till being a pro and Might have decided
            ...which actions give rewards for u and which are non
            rewarding...... And will repeat that rewarding actions...learning
            not to do non rewarding actions..... And repeating the similar
            exploring for long time u must have became a pro....
          </p>
          <p>
            The above described are the few methods [steps] in which we humans
            learn.......
          </p>
          <p><strong>THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE LEARN.......</strong></p>
          <h4>
            <strong
              >WE WILL MIMIC THE SAME STEPS OF LEARNING FOR MACHINES TO MAKE
              THEM LEARN ML MODEL.....
            </strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            How we humans learn is by observing all the data[info] from the
            world and making some conclusions.....
          </p>
          <p>
            ML MODEL is like a virtual guy who observed data and made patterns
            from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we do in case of machines is...... We expose it to vast
            data.....And help it to observe data and find notable patterns and
            this patterns can be similarly compared to a explicitly coded
            program by human ...cause the explicitly coded program by human is
            just the pattern human observed from vast data around him
          </p>
          <p>
            So, We expose systems to vast data.....And help it to observe data
            and find notable patterns.... Let's look it in short steps
          </p>
          <div class="img-block">
            <img src="images/2.jpeg" alt="" class="img-one img-extra--width" />
          </div>
          <h3 class="margin">
            <strong>1. EXPOSING SYSTEM TO LARGE DATA</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            we humans are smart enough just cause we are exposed to large
            data..... All the time....with all our 5 senses like eyes [8k
            resolution] and analyzing it....
          </p>
          <p>
            We are able to get data through senses.... And we use the data To
            analyze,and find pattrens But for Machines we can directly give data
            In some form [ like rows, columns]to analyze....
          </p>
          <p>
            So, first thing is to learn to manipulate data and make fine data
            information.... So we can make system to analyze it
          </p>
          <p>
            We finally needed to feed our ml model with data.....very vast
            amount of data..... The more the data the better the pattern
            recognising happens in ml ,so we sometimes are going to use data
            with even lakhs to crores of columns. As its information era it's
            possible to get as much as the data required in digital form
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem in dealing with millions of columns is that there will
            be few bugs in the data.... Like.... Few places in tables maybe
            empty without values the data format of the columns we need may be
            different
          </p>
          <h4>
            <strong
              >THE MODEL DONT KNOW HOW TO OVERCOME THESE BUGS TO THE STAGE
              ANALYSE</strong
            >
          </h4>
          <p>
            So we will learn the way in which we can work with vast data with
            few bugs, and convert it to clean data without bugs.... And we are
            going to feed clean data to ml model
          </p>
          <p>
            We are going to use few popular libraries.....for efficient data
            manipulation The libraries are...
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Numpy (works with numeric data)</strong></li>

          </h3>
          <p>
            Observing the data and finding patterns is where it's a little
            hard... We are about to make different types of observation rules
            (observing algorithms) for different type of learning
          </p>
          <p>And there are three types of learning</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>SUPERVISED LEARNING</strong></li>
            <li><strong>UNSUPERVISED LEARNING</strong></li>
            <li><strong>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING</strong></li>

          </div>
          <h2 class="margin"><strong>SUPERVISED LEARNING</strong></h2>
          <p>
            The data feeded to machine.....is already classified under different
            labels.......and machine has to find patterns of data under each
            label.... When a new data comes in it will try to find its label
          </p>
          <h2><strong>UNSUPERVISED LEARNING</strong></h2>
          <p>
            In this type of learning the data is feeded without any
            classification....to machine....and the machine will try to find
            patterns in data
          </p>
          <h2><strong>REINFORCEMENT LEARNING</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Is a type of learning In which there will be a agent....(virtual
            man) preforming actions In Environment.... And learning on basis of
            reward

            CLASSIFICATION algorithms
          </p>
          <h2><strong>REGRESSION</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Regression consists of mathematical methods that allows data to
            predict a continuous outcome (y) based on the value of one or more
            predictor variables (x).

          </div>
          <p class="margin">
            The most popular Regressions are Linear regression & Logistic
            regression
          </p>
          <h3 class="margin"><strong>LINEAR REGRESSION</strong></h3>
          <p>
            It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis or
            finding strength of independent variables (predicrors) . Linear
            regression makes predictions for numeric variables such as, age,
            stock price, etc.

          </div>

          <h3 class="margin"><strong>LOGISTIC REGRESSION</strong></h3>
          <p>
            the logistic model is used to model the probability of a certain
            class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, in other words
            0 or 1. This can be extended to model several classes of events such
            as determining whether an image contains a plane ,helicopter, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The continuous range of the independent variables are going to
            produce the value of dependent variable between 0-1

          </div>
          <h2 class="margin"><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong></h2>
          <p>
            The Classification algorithms are used to identify the category of
            new observations on the basis of given training data .here training
            data is feed to ml model with labels . And it helps in mapping the
            new data to the declared labels. The main purpose of classification
            is to group data by labels.
          </p>
          <p>The most popular Classifications are</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Decision Tree</li>
            <li>Random Forest</li>
            <li>Naive bayes</li>
            <li>KNN</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><strong>1. Decision Tree</strong></h3>
          <p>
            In this method the model is going to make a set of questions that is
            going to separate data of predictable label to the most possible
            extent and forms a branched tree from of the table

          <p>This system is followed by dessision tree</p>
          <h4><strong>Entropy</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Entropy is a metric to measure the impurity in a given attribute. It
            specifies randomness in data. Entropy can be calculated as:
          </p>
          <h4>Entropy(s)= -P(yes)log2 P(yes)- P(no)log2 P(no)</h4>
          <p>where,</p>
          <p>S = Total number of samples</p>
          <p>P(yes) = probability of yes</p>
          <p>P(no) = probability of no</p>
          <h4><strong>INFORMATION GAIN :</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Information gain is the measurement of changes in entropy after the
            segmentation of a dataset based on an attribute.

          <p>
            Naive Bayes is a machine learning model that is used for large
            volumes of data, even if you are working with data that has millions
            of data records the recommended approach is Naive Bayes .it works on
            the basic bayes theorem .it is based on idea that a presence of
            feature in a class is unrelated to any of the other feature in the
            class

            the radar for a new sample. It's going to Check which class has the
            more influence in the radar k, and the k value is experimented for
            different cases and chooses the more efficient one

            It is called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from
            the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at
            the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.

          <h2 class="margin"><strong>UNSUPERVISED LEARNING</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models
            are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that
            data without
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying
            structure of dataset, group that data according to similarities, and
            represent that dataset in a compressed format
          </p>
          <p>
            Unsupervised learning is much similar as a human learns to think by
            their own experiences, which makes it closer to the real AI.

          <p>
            Clustering is a method of grouping the objects into clusters such
            that objects with most similarities remains into a group and has
            less or no similarities with the objects of another.

          <p>
            An association rule is an unsupervised learning method which is used
            for finding the relationships between variables in the large
            database. It determines the set of items that occurs together in the
            dataset. Association rule makes marketing strategy more effective.
            Such as people who buy X item (suppose a bread) are also tend to
            purchase Y (Butter/Jam) item.

            It is a UNIQUE TYPE OF LEARNING..... IN which the ml model is not
            going to learn from previous data but is going to live in the moment
            and do the actions in the environment..... And it's going to get
            feedback in the form of reward or punishment.the more the actions
            the better the feed back ,the better the feedback the better it
            performs tasks in the future .the ML model is called as agent .and
            the place where it performs actions is called environment
