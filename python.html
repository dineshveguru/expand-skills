          <h1><strong>What is the program and Why.....?</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Computers have amazing memory & speed but it can't do the work which
            I want if I don't Express the work to it. so, to utilise the
            computer speed we must know how to interact with a computer The
            language in which the understanding between you and computer is
            taken place is called programming language and there are many
            programming languages few popular are Python, C, C++,Java etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programming language is just a tool to talk to a computer. It's not
            only the tool, that's important, but what u are able to create with
            tool. Programming with any language is just like sculpting with
            Chisel. Programming language is just a tool.....What can you do with
            it is what matters.......
          </p>
          <p>
            Program code written in the text from is converted into machine
            language by Compiler. Machine language is the language which
            hardware can understand it's just 0 's and 1's Convening the current
            is in respective circuit or not
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >PYTHON IS THE EASIEST AND EFFICIENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE......IT
              HAS A LARGE COMMUNITY…WITH MANY BUILT IN MODULES TO HELP U
              WITH.</strong

        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h1><strong>simple python code </strong></h1>
          <p>the sample code of python language looks like this</p>
          <pre>
                <code class="python">
a =100
b=1
c=a+b
print(c)

                </code>
            </pre>
          <p>
            When we run the code. It's like saying to computer Hey read line to
            line in code and Do the work assigned. Before knowing what this code
            means let's take a look at how program works and basic python code .
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h1><strong>How Programming Works</strong></h1>
          <p>programming syncs with humans in following ways.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Storing data in a classified way.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Applying logic condition for Executing various tasks</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <div>
            <p>
              lets look into first one ie. Storing data in a classified way.
            </p>
            <p>What comes to mind by observing below rows....</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>car, bike, truck , bus , bicycle</p></li>
              <li><p>red, green ,blue, white, black</p></li>
              <li><p>2.4,5.5,56.4,53.4</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>These are the set of memory in our brain ,in form of classes.</p>
            <p>
              Similarly ,there are few inbuilt classification(Data Types) in c
              as
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>int</strong> &emsp; &lt;for integers&gt;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>str</strong> &emsp; &lt;for strings&gt;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>float</strong> &emsp; &lt;for decimal values&gt;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>bool</strong> &emsp; &lt;for boolean values&gt;</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>and these are called <strong>Data Types</strong></p>
            <p>
              So if we want to store something in python we must state to which
              class it belongs to And this is basic statement for storing data
            </p>
            <pre>
                  <code class="python">
int Score = 777;
Score = 777
Team="Expand Skills"
Numfloat= 4.21 
Raining? = True  
                  </code>
                      </pre>
            <p>
              The above are statements in python code,Telling systems to store
              different types of data.
            </p>
            <p>
              The above code conveys system to store data..777,"Expand
              Skills",4.21 in memory with placing an ID tag(Variable) of Score ,
              ,Team ,Numfloat,Raining? respectively When we want to acsess the
              data we are going to use id tag(Variable) to access it.

          <h1><strong>Comments</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Comments are text in your python program and they are ignored by the
            compiler. Commenting in python will start from # as shown below:

              List is a collection of same type of data items stored in a
              continuous memory allocations and the data in it are called
              elements. the position index is to identify where the respective

            <p>
              Functions are a group of lines which will process code.U can
              imagine it as a pack of code… once u call The function the code in
              the pack will get executed… General syntax of function in python:
              There are many inbuilt functions in python for strings, list and
              many popular Libraries for function let's know about them later…
