          <h1><strong>What is the program and why....?</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Computers have amazing memory & speed but it can't do the work which
            I want if I don't Express the work to it. so, to utilise the
            computer speed we must know how to interact with a computer The
            language in which the understanding between you and computer is
            taken place is called programming language and there are many
            programming languages few popular are Python, C++,Java etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programming language is just a tool to talk to a computer. It's not
            only the tool, that's important, but what u are able to create with
            tool. Programming with any language is just like sculpting with
            Chisel.
          </p>
          <p>Programming language is just a tool</p>
          <p><strong>What can you do with it is what matters.......</strong></p>
          <p>
            Program code written in the text from is converted into machine
            language by Compiler. Machine language is the language which
            hardware can understand it's just 0 's and 1's Convening the current
            is in respective circuit or not.
          </p>

        <div class="content-block">
          <h1><strong>Simple C code</strong></h1>
          <p>the sample code of c language looks like this</p>
          <pre>
              <code class="c">
#include  &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int  main()
    {
        int a =78;
        int b=34;
        int add=a+b;
        printf("%d",c);
        return add;
    }
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            When we run the code. It's like saying to computer Hey read line to
            line in code and Do the work assigned. Before knowing what this code
            means let's take a look at how program works and basic C syntax .
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <h1><strong>How Programming Works</strong></h1>
          <p>programming syncs with humans in following ways.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Storing data in a classified way.</p></li>
            <li><p>Applying logic condition for Executing various tasks</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>lets look into first one ie. Storing data in a classified way.</p>
          <p>What comes to mind by observing below rows....</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>car, bike, truck , bus , bicycle</p></li>
            <li><p>red, green ,blue, white, black</p></li>
            <li><p>2.4,5.5,56.4,53.4</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>These are the set of memory in our brain ,in form of classes.</p>
          <p>
            Similarly ,there are few inbuilt classification(Data Types) in c as
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>int</strong> &emsp; &lt;for integers&gt;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>char</strong> &emsp; &lt;for strings&gt;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>float</strong> &emsp; &lt;for decimal values&gt;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>double</strong> &emsp; &lt;for high precision decimal
                values&gt;
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>and these are called <strong>Data Types</strong></p>
          <p>
            So if we want to store something in c we must state to which class
            it belongs to And this is basic statement for storing data
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="c">
int Score = 777;
char Grade="A";
char Team[20]="Expand Skills" //[20] is the limit of chars
float numfloat= 4.21 // 7 decimal digit precision
double numdouble= 2.398347342 // 15 decimal digit precision
            </code>
                </pre>
          <p>
            The above are statements in c code,Telling systems to store diffrent
            types of data.
          </p>
          <p>Any statements in c must terminate with semicolon ;</p>
          <p>
            The above code conveys system to store data..777,"A","Expand
            Skills",4.21,2.398347342 in memory with placing an ID
            tag(IDENTIFIER) of Score ,Grade ,Team ,numfloat ,numdouble
            respectively When we want to acsess the data we are going to use id
            tag(IDENTIFIER) to acess it another way of storing data is by using
            array
